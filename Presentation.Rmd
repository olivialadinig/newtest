## Course Project

- This is the final course project for Data Products Course on Coursera's Data Science Spezialization. 
- The goal was to create a shiny application, including this pitch presentation.
- This is it :) 

## Subject matter

I have choosen to make an app that predicts diamond prices from various features,
utilizing the diamonds data set that is included in the ggplot2 package of R. 
The features are

- carat
- cut
- color
- clarity


## Slide with R Output
Here is a sample output of the full dataset with the first 6 cases. 
```{r diamonds, echo = TRUE}
head(diamonds)
```
